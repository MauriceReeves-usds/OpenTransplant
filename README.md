### Project Ethos

We believe every country and community, regardless of wealth or ability, should be able to operate an organ transplant network for its citizens. We believe this organ transplant network should be safe, auditable, free of fraud, waste, and abuse; we believe this system should benefit life and reduce death. 

### Key Features & Road Map:
- organ decay is reduced
- patient outcomes are optimized for
- underserved populations and communities of color are measured against population for equity (TODO: think about how we can convey importance of data analytics and preventatitve warnings to policy makers)
- the system can measure end to end actions and the implications of policy changes quickly and easily
- the system should be near real-time with zero downtime
- the system should not require paper or human intervention
- the system will be modern and incorporate medical research (HLA crossmatching, organ sizing innovations, modern logistics & tracking)

### Sources & Thanks

This entire application was designed and built using publically available information from OPTN, UNOs, and HRSA found via Google as well as numerous medical papers from scholarly journals. See PAPERS.md (TODO: must add citations & PAPER.md file for medical lit.) for details.

- Web API Layer: Elixir Phoenix Web API Stack
- FrontEnd: Node.js, SCSS styling
- Backend Matching & Scheduling: OCaml services

### Tech Road Map

1. Webapp for OPOs
2. Webapp for Patient
3. EHR FHIR API integration for EPIC & Cerner
4. Gherkin & Cucumber Scenario tests for each organ & user health

### Out of Box Functionality: 

Currently, the code base combines a lot of new, novel ideas, but these will soon be refactored into an experimental (Living Donors being combined with Deceased Donors donations, etc) module inside of Policy. There is also experimental support for tissue types beyond OPTN policy reference, but out of box support will not include these. This implementation is merely a possibile reference implenetation for public OPTN algorithms for waitlist and matching. 

## Build & Run

### OCaml Environment

#### Windows Machine

1. Follow these instructions to get WSL for Debian: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
2. apt-get install ocaml
3. Proceed to Build step

#### Linux

1. apt-get install ocaml
2. Proceed to Build step

#### OSX

1. brew install ocaml
2. Proceed to Build step

### Visual Studio Code Setup

Packages Used:

- OCaml and Reason IDE (@ext:freebroccolo.reasonml)
- Remote - WSL  (@ext:ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
- FiraCode (install _is not_ through VSCode store, but rather follow instructions here: https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode >> and change font-family setting in **VSCode > Editor** to `"Fira-Code"`)
- Docker - (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) to install 

### Build

Go to root directory where `dune-project` is and run:

```
sh build.sh
sh start.sh
```
